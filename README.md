# Portfolio Website

I am a budding web developer that transitioned from data science and analytics and this is my portfolio site for web development!

It includes some tutorials examples I have completed with my own twist, along with other information about me and my career journey thus far.

This is the first website I built using what I have learned with HTML/CSS and Javascript. 

I plan to update and add more projects to it as I learn and grow as a web developer!

## Credits

Projects are inspired by tutorials from freeCodeCamp.
